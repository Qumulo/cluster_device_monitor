The cluster_state.py script will serve the purpose of recording and keeping 
track of the cluster state related to the health of nodes/drives. The script
will first need to check for a cluster state file, and create one if it doesn't
already exist. If it does exist, then the script will compare the previous and
current state of nodes & drives.
